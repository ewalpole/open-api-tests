    "description": "## Documentation conventions\nThe documentation does not show URL endpoints.  Rather, it displays a path to retrieve endpoint details from the `resources` section of the /discovery result.  For example, the documentation describes the call to exportpdf as: `GET assets.exportpdf`.\n`discovery_result.resources.assets.exportpdf` returns something like:\n\n```\n\"exportpdf\": {\n  \"http_method\": \"POST\",\n  \"content_type\": {\n    \"exportpdf_parameters_v1.json\":\n        \"application/vnd.adobe.dc+json;profile=\\\"https://dc-api.adobe.io/schemas/exportpdf_parameters_v1.json\\\"\"\n  },\n  \"accept\": {\n    \"new_asset_job_v1.json\":\n        \"application/vnd.adobe.dc+json;profile=\\\"https://dc-api.adobe.io/schemas/new_asset_job_v1.json\\\"\"\n  },\n  \"uri\": \"https://dc-api.adobe.io/1467304330/assets?operation=exportpdf\",\n  \"authentication\": [\"auth_header_primary\"]\n}\n```\nBut more importantly, `assets.exportpdf` is the parameter to the SDK `call()` method needed to identify the method.\n\n## Versioning\n### Compatibility\nWhen changing a given API method it is highly desirable to make those changes backwards-compatible. To facilitate this, clients should ignore result parameters that they do not expect (and, in general, a key in any dictionary). Backwards-compatible changes include\n* Adding a new method\n* Adding new parameters to a method that default to the previous behavior when omitted\n* Adding new options to input parameters\n* Returning new result parameters (clients should ignore results they don't expect)\n\nIncompatible changes include:\n* Removing a method\n* Removing input parameters\n* Changing the semantics of a method\n* Changing the name of a method, input parameter, or result parameter\n* Removing a result value\n\nAdding a new enum choice to a result parameter will sometimes be a breaking change, but at other times will be acceptable. For example, an API that performs document conversions will have an enum describing various conversion failures. Clients must be prepared to handle unrecognised additions to this enumeration. In other cases, enumerations may require that a client handle all possible variations. In this case extending the enumeration requires a new version of the resource. DC API documentation clarifies which enums are extensible without version changes.\n\n### Versioning Mechanism\nWhen versioning becomes necessary, API methods are not directly versioned.  Rather the data passed to them and returned by them is versioned by updating the reference to the JSON Schema. JSON Schema entries use a naming convention that incorporates a version number.\n\nResponses returning JSON include a Content-Type header corresponding to the schema of the result they are returning. Requests must include an `Accept` header indicating the schema(s) it is prepared to receive. If the client requests a schema that the server cannot support, the server returns a 406 `Not Acceptable` error. If the client provides a content-type that the server cannot consume, the server responds with a 415 `Unsupported Media Type Error`.\n\n\n### Version Warnings\nWhen a client requests a resource version that's not the most recent, the response includes this header: <br>\n`x-version-available: <newer-version-content-type>`\n<br>When a client requests a resource version that has been deprecated, the response includes this header:<br>\n`x-version-deprecated: <version-content-type>`\n\n### Versioning Example\nVersioning is managed on the principles of [server-driven content negotiation](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html).\nFor example:\n`GET /foo` returns the content type: `application/vnd.adobe.dc+json; profile=\"https://dc-api.adobe.io/schemas/foo_v1.json\"`\n\n`POST /foo` accepts the same content type. When we make a breaking change to the asset schema, we create a new version of the schema supported by both GET and POST: `https://dc-api.adobe.io/schemas/foo_v2.json`.\n\nThe caller to `GET /foo` may specify either:\n\n`Accept: application/vnd.adobe.dc+json; profile=\"https://dc-api.adobe.io/schemas/foo_v1.json\"`\n\nor<br>\n`Accept: application/vnd.adobe.dc+json; profile=\"https://dc-api.adobe.io/schemas/foo_v2.json\"`\n\nSimilarly, a request to POST /asset will accept either:\n\n`Content-Type: application/vnd.adobe.dc+json; profile=\"https://dc-api.adobe.io/schemas/foo_v1.json\"`\n\nor<br>\n`Content-Type: application/vnd.adobe.dc+json; profile=\"https://dc-api.adobe.io/schemas/foo_v2.json\"`\n\n## Consistency\nThe Document Cloud API uses a model of \"Eventual Consistency\" in order to achieve high availability.\nEventual Consistency means that clients may temporarily encounter inconsistent states while update operations are replicated throughout the distributed system.\n\nExamples of possible inconsistency:\n* Metadata for a recently uploaded asset may not be complete; for example, page count might not be populated.\n* Querying renditions for an asset may return a 404 response until the rendition has been generated.\n* Any read immediately after a write may return old information.\n\nA client that encounters an inconsistent state needs to take corrective action. Normally this action is simply to wait for a short duration and retry the operation.\n\n## End Of Life Policy\nAdobe makes best the effort to minimize or avoid deprecating APIs and resources.\nAPIs and resource versions are guaranteed to be supported for a minimum of 3 years from their release date. In order to mature and improve the quality and performance of the API, versions that are more than three years old might cease to be supported.\n\nAPIs and resource versions will be supported for a minimum of 1 year after being declared as deprecated. Adobe will notify customers API resource versions planned for deprecation.\n",

Clients must use a URI template library to produce URI values.\n * If the URI itself is parameterized, the name of the parameter will be returned in the `resource_parameter` property.\n * Method authentication is determined by the `authentication` array.  An API can support more than one authentication scheme. The possible values in the array are: `auth_header_primary, ticket, unauthenticated`. The most common value is: `auth_header_primary` which indicates the caller needs to populate an `Authorization` header with a primary access Bearer token.\n * If a method expects content, the request `Content-Type` header value must be populated with a value from the `content_type` map.\n * If a method returns content, the request `Accept` header must be populated with a value from the `accept` map.",

        "description": "Download the assets or folder with the specified ids as a single zip file. The intent of this API is to allow browser based clients to download multiple files with one action. It may also be useful for other purposes.\n\nThe parameters are passed in a json object in the request body.  You can either specify a list of up to 50 asset IDs, or a single folder ID.  A list of asset IDs will produce a flat (no folder hierarchy) zip file containing the assets. Note that it is possible to get a single asset in a zip file.  A single folder ID will produce a zip file that contains all the assets in the folder preserving the hierarchy of the folder specified (except empty folders are not included).\n\nBe sure to specify the time_zone_offset parameter with the correct value for the local timezone the client is running in, so that the modification times in the resulting zip file will be as the user expects.\n\nThe response is a zip file. The default name for the zip file is \"documents.zip\" if you specified a list of asset uris, or the name of the folder for a folder uri. File names will be stored in the zip file in UTF-8 encoding.

        "x-description": "<p>Download the assets or folder with the specified ids as a single zip file. The intent of this API is to allow browser based clients to download multiple files with one action. It may also be useful for other purposes.</p>\n<p>The parameters are passed in a json object in the request body.  You can either specify a list of up to 50 asset IDs, or a single folder ID.  A list of asset IDs will produce a flat (no folder hierarchy) zip file containing the assets. Note that it is possible to get a single asset in a zip file.  A single folder ID will produce a zip file that contains all the assets in the folder preserving the hierarchy of the folder specified (except empty folders are not included).</p>\n<p>Be sure to specify the time_zone_offset parameter with the correct value for the local timezone the client is running in, so that the modification times in the resulting zip file will be as the user expects.</p>\n<p>The response is a zip file. The default name for the zip file is &quot;documents.zip&quot; if you specified a list of asset uris, or the name of the folder for a folder uri. File names will be stored in the zip file in UTF-8 encoding.
